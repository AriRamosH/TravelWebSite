It records the gift of revenue from certain fields to the Abagara Vihare (Abhagiri or Amaragiri Vihare) at Velgama by a General named Abaya.

      <td><h3>Galle</h3>
          <p>
              Galle is a city on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. It’s known for Galle Fort, the fortified old city founded by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century.

          <h3>Take a walk on the ramparts</h3> 
          <p>
              Galle is a walled city surrounded by thick ramparts. These were built by the Dutch merchants that controlled the city in the 17th century. The ramparts are so thick that you can walk along them – start at one end and finish at the other. Look towards the ocean, see the old prison between the ramparts and the waves, check out the lighthouse and the clock tower and watch the schoolboys during cricket practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Check out the Dutch architecture</h3>
          <p>
              When the Dutch ran the East India Company out of Galle Fort, they left behind plenty of constructions. The ramparts themselves are a pretty impressive architectural construction, but there are others worth seeing. The Maritime Archaeology Museum in a building inside the ramparts was once the Dutch Warehouse. Another great example of Dutch architecture is the Groote Kerk and the Amangalla hotel.

      <h3>Ella</h3>
      <p>
          The area has a rich bio-diversity, dense with numerous varieties of flora and fauna. Ella is surrounded by hills covered with cloud forests and tea plantations. The town has a cooler climate than surrounding lowlands, due to its elevation. The Ella Gap allows views across the southern plains of Sri Lanka. On a sunny morning, you can even see the glow from the lighthouses along the southern coast.
      </p>
      <p>
          By rail. Ella's a few stops from Badulla at the end of the railway line that snakes through the Hill Country. Trains go to Colombo and Kandy from here. The fares are ludicrously cheap in 2nd and 3rd class, and the views spectacular. It's usually no problem getting a seat in 2nd/3rd class going to Colombo or Kandy, as the trains from Badulla are quite empty until reaching Nanu Oya. However the reverse is true going up to Ella and it can be quite crowded until the last 2 or 3 hours of the journey. Ella's railway station itself is prettily quaint. there are many travelers who visit ella by train.
      </p>
      <p>
          By Road, Buses go south through Ella Gap to Wellawaya where you can change for a number of destinations in the south of the island.
      </p>
      <p>
          The climate throughout most of the year is typical of the high Hill Country, with a hot sun by midday, but a moderate air temperature. It will often rain in the afternoon, but only for an hour or so. A sweatshirt, or light jacket is needed at night. In December it can rain a lot!
